What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When i initialised the git repository in my reflections 
repository it will make an empty git repository with 
zero commits in it. This is needed in order to tell 
git that it has a directory now which will store meta 
data about the history of the files 
when we make a first commit.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is the directory in which you 
are currently working in while as the staging area 
is the place where we add up our changed files 
for which we want the changes to be commited. 
It offers more control over the changes 
we want to commit in our repository.
